    description: "<p>Sammen om en jobb is an organization, running a mentoring program with a goal to help refugees and immigrants in Norway with a higher education in getting a relevant job. With the help from a mentor, they will get help writing CV, applying to jobs, learn about Norwegian work culture and generally just getting a step closer in getting a job. The organization needed a better system to handle an increasing number of people applying to the program, ways to automate their email processes, an easier way to match a mentor and mentee and generally improve their business processes. Also, they wanted a web portal where both mentors and mentee could follow up their mentor program. </p><p> The project was my summer internship project, working for Accenture in Salesforce Business Group. Through the project the goal was to tailor a CRM-solution (Customer Relationship Management) in the Salesforce platform to fulfill the customerâ€™s needs. Working in a team of 3 summer interns, we managed to get quite far both declaratively and programmatically tailoring the platform to be able to handle a lot of automation considering the application processes, emailing, follow-up of mentors and mentees and defining the data model that was going to be used. In addition to this we used Salesforce Community to expose data in the CRM to the mentors and mentees going through a mentor program. There they can log their meetings, set up goals for what they want to work with and engage with other people in the mentor program to help each other and socialize. I was really engaging to work with a project that we knew from the start would make a huge difference to the organization, users and have a huge value for society. We worked with an agile methodology, user testing every week and keeping close communication with the customer. For managing tasks, we used Trello, to easily be able to get an overview in a Trello view. </p><p>Through the project I have worked mainly declaratively and also backend with Apex classes, Apex triggers and Apex testing, which is a language quite similar to Java, where you can use SOQL (similar to SQL) to talk to the data model. I wrote different logic for automatization of different information gathering processes and for creating users for contacts in the CRM automatically, when a mentor or mentee is accepted for the program. Also, I worked on the first steps of the application process, where I used Web-to-Lead on the customers Squarespace website to get the initial information about a person. Here I used HTML and CSS. One goal in this project was to get a good overview of everything we created in the project, so with tight communication with my teammates and supervisors, I got deep insight in what they created and contributed to their work as well. In Salesforce you can create custom Lightning Components, which is similar to developing components in React or other web frameworks, and I felt that my previous experience with this was useful for the project. </p>"

It's is a very practical, project-based course where we learned a lot about web development. First we had a project where we used basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript and had requirements about things like using CSS Flexbox. In our second project we made a website about seasons. We chose the theme ourselves, because the only requirement about theme was that we had to make a website for something we are grateful for. We created a website we think is beautiful, and it has many clever solutions. After this project we had a project where we used React and HTML LocalStorage. For the fourth and last project we used Angular.js with node.js. We launched all of our projects on a Linux server at NTNU.</p>"
